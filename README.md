# 3D_Bowling_Game
A simple 3D game, developed for the Graphics course in ECE-TUC. Implemented in Unity3D. Specific instructions for reproducing will be added soon. For now, this repository contains the project report (in greek), the project requirements by the professor (in english), and the C# scripts.

You can run the game (only tested for Windows 10) by downloading the Bowling_Final_Version_v1.exe from the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cyuu6sd3z6pezaz/AABFk00JVzUIPPwTOi0xofbha?dl=0
